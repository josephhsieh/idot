#summary Initial wiki page for the project

Welcome to the iDot program.

iDot is intended for use when viewing diagrams created by SpinSpider, but it is a general tool for viewing any diagram written in the Dot language of GraphViz.

The project is stable. If you have technical questions, please write to Mikko Vinni, the student at the University of Joensuu (Finland) who developed the project under my supervision. General questions can be addressed to me.
